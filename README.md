The starting point was data on a company that sells coffee in different presentations, of various types, to clients in 3 countries and that has a loyalty program with data from 2019 to 2022.  The aim is to know the specific sales by period, be able to use filters about the type of coffee, the size of the clients belonging or not to the loyalty program, and to see the percentage that each one represents according to the country.
